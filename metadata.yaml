description: This extraordinary fragment, left incomplete at the author's death, hints
  at the direction Hawthorne's genius may have taken had he lived. Ironically, the
  subject is the search through science rather than magic for an elixir of life. Poignantly,
  the unfinished manuscript lay upon Hawthorne's coffin during the author's funeral
  services.
